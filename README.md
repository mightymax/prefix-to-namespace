# Prefix to Namespace extension for Visual Studio Code

This is the README for your extension "ttl-prefix-generator". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

- Using the Command Palette (cmd = `prefix.fetch`):
  1. type a prefix in the inputbox; or
  2. make a selection of a prefix in your dicument before running the command.
- Using Autocomplete for Turtle and/or TriG files:
  - start typing a prefix appended with `@`, e.g. `@schema` and confirm the correct prefix

## Notes
This extension uses data from [prefix.cc](http://prefix.cc), this extensioon was not possible without their great work! This extension uses a [static download of their data](http://prefix.cc/popular/all.file.json). I will update this extension once in a while should new prefixes be available.
